<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>Owing to the growing popularity of the fascinating art of lace-making
and the appeals of our readers to place it within their reach, we have
prepared this pamphlet. In making it a perfect instructor and a reliable
exponent of the favorite varieties of lace, we have spared neither time
nor expense, and are most happy to offer to our patrons what a
celebrated maker of Modern Lace has pronounced as "the finest book upon
lace-making to be found on either continent."</p>

<p>The illustrations, in the main, are direct reproductions from genuine,
hand-made modern laces, such as any lady may make who masters the
instructions found upon these pages.</p>

<p>The beauty of these laces is beyond question, their durability all that
can be desired, and their textures may be varied from an extreme
delicacy to a sumptuous opposite. In introducing the art of modern
lace-making into the realms of our readers, we feel all of the pleasure
we are sure we thus convey.</p>

<p class="dc">
The art of making lace in one form or another has existed from the
earliest ages. There are Scriptural references to various web-like
fabrics, which were of rude construction, no doubt, but whose general
characteristics were identical with those productions of modern skill
which have for centuries been known as lace. Homer and other ancient
writers constantly mention net-works of fancifully embroidered
materials; gold thread-work was known to the Romans; and as Egyptian
robes of state are depicted upon the tombs of the earlier dynasties as
being fashioned from a looped net-work or crochet, it is probable that
the Israelites learned the art from the Egyptians. Museums contain
specimens of lace dating back to periods that to us of the present day
seem mere dreams of reigns and eras, and history includes a scattered
literature of lace which proves that the art must have been practised
almost from the beginning.</p>

<p class="dc">Up to the Sixteenth Century, however, open work embroidery was the
favorite decoration, and from it the tangible origin of lace seems
derived. During the Renaissance period the first book of embroidery
patterns and lace-work appeared. The earliest volume bearing a date was
printed at Cologne in 1527; and it was during the reign of Richard III.
of England that the word lace was first used in the descriptions of the
royal wardrobe.</p>

<p class="dc">At first the best known laces were those of Venice, Milan and Genoa. The
Italians claim the invention of point or needle-made lace; but the
Venetian point is now a product of the past, and England and France
supply most of the fine laces of the present time.</p>

<p>Lace-makers in the various European countries are trained to the work
from childhood; but it is said that the makers of Honiton lace, the
fabric of which Queen Victoria's wedding gown was made, are rapidly
decreasing in numbers, so that there are few persons now living who
understand the construction of this exquisite "pillow" lace. The costly
point and Honiton and the dainty Mechlin and Valenciennes of bygone days
can only be produced by trained lace-workers, whose skilful fingers
weave bobbins of cobweb-like thread to and fro over the "pillow"
necessary to antique methods; and for this reason fine lace-making is
practically beyond the skill of the amateur. Besides, some of the
threads in the very filmy laces are so fine that they cannot be
successfully manipulated except in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> moist atmosphere, such as that of
Great Britain; and even there some of the more exquisite specimens must
perforce be made in underground rooms, since it is only there that the
proper degree of moisture can be obtained. In dry climates these
gossamer-like threads would roughen and break at almost the slightest
touch.</p>

<p>Referring to the known origin of some of the earlier laces, a writer
upon the subject says:</p>

<p>"They say it was a woman, Barbara Uttmann, who invented pillow lace in
the 16th century. Women have ever been patrons of lace-making. Victoria
has kept the Honiton laces in fashion, and it was the Duchess of Argyle
who introduced lace-making in Scotland. The Countess of Erne and Lady
Denny and Lady Bingham began it in Ireland, and Lady De Vere gave her
own Brussels point for patterns when the first Irish point was made at
Curragh. It was Elizabeth of Denmark who introduced lace-making in that
country, and the Archduchess Sophia who started lace schools in Bohemia.
"Now at least I can have laces," said Anne of Austria, when Louis XIII.,
her husband died, and her court was famous for its cleanliness and its
Spanish point. Colbert had three women as coadjutors when he started
lace-making in France. It was because Josephine loved point d'Alen&ccedil;on
that Napoleon revived it. Eugenie spent $5,000 for a single dress
flounce, and had $1,000,000 in fine laces."</p>

<p>Victoria's favorite, Honiton, is not considered a particularly beautiful
lace, although its weaving is so tedious and difficult. "Real Honiton
laces," so says an authority, "are made up of bits and bits fashioned by
many different women in their own little cottages&mdash;here a leaf, there a
flower, slowly woven through the long, weary days, only to be united
afterward in the precious web by other workers who never saw its
beginning. There is a pretty lesson in the thought that to the
perfection of each of these little pieces the beauty of the whole is
due&mdash;that the rose or leaf some humble peasant woman wrought carefully,
helps to make the fabric worthy the adorning of a queen or the
decoration of an altar, even as the sweetness and patient perfection in
any life makes all living more worthy and noble. A single flower upon
which taste and fancy were lavished, and which sustained and deft labor
brought to perfection, represents the lives of many diligent women
workers.</p>

<p>It has become so much the fashion to worship all things ancient that
most lovers of fine lace would prefer to have it a century old; and yet
there never was a time when laces were more beautiful, more artistic and
more unique in design than just at the present day; for modern laces
preserve the best features of the laces that have gone before them, and
have added so many new inspirations that except for the sentiment, the
romance or the history connecting this scrap with a title, that with a
famous beauty, and another with some cathedral's sacred treasure, the
palm would certainly be given to the gauze-like production of the poor
flax thread spinner of the present day."</p>

<p>Not all people know the difference between point lace which is made with
the needle, and pillow lace which is made with the bobbins&mdash;but much of
the beautiful point lace of the present day is made with the needle, and
its beauty stands a favorable comparison with the more costly pillow
lace.</p>

<p>Strictly modern lace-making is a result of American ingenuity, and it
has so simple a basis and is so easy to learn that any woman of average
skill may, with little difficulty, pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>duce by its different processes,
laces that are really magnificent and quite as substantial and useful as
they are exquisitely beautiful. In America modern lace-making has been
developed to a high degree of perfection by its pioneer, Mrs. Grace B.
McCormick, in whose designing rooms at No. 923 Broadway, New York, may
be seen specimens of modern laces of every variety, from dainty
needle-point to a very elaborate kind known as the Royal Battenburg.
This English name for an American production was selected in honor of
the Battenburg nuptials, which occurred about the time a patent for
making the lace was applied for at Washington. Only a few years have
elapsed since this plucky little woman made a single piece of lace
edging from common braid as an experiment, and sold it for a trifling
sum. Love for the work and perseverance have enabled her to overcome
obstacles that would have discouraged a woman of ordinary energy, and
she has gradually improved upon her earlier methods until modern lace
occupies a front rank among the numerous dainty forms of needle-work of
the day.</p>

<p>One of the finest specimens lately placed on exhibition is a table-cloth
intended for use at elaborate dinners. It is made of the finest table
linen and Royal Battenburg lace. The cloth is, of course, very large,
and the lace, in the form of wide insertion, is let in above the border
and is also arranged to divide the center into three squares. An outside
border of edging to match completes this exquisite production, which has
been two years in course of construction, and is valued at four hundred
and seventy-five dollars. The same style of lace may be made by any one
who studies the art and in any width or form, and it may be produced in
many textures, although really intended for heavy effects. The making of
such lace possesses a great charm for womankind in general, and will
undoubtedly retain favor as long as needlecraft remains a pastime and
employment with the gentler sex.</p>


<h3>MATERIALS.</h3>

<p>The requirements of modern lace-making are few. The products are classed
as Honiton, Point, Duchesse, Princesse, Royal Battenburg or Old English
Point, etc., etc.; but all are made with various braids arranged in
different patterns and connected by numerous kinds of stitches, many
different stitches often appearing in one variety of lace.</p>

<p>The materials required are neither numerous nor expensive. The following
is a complete list: Tracing cloth, leather or <i>toile cir&eacute;e</i>, lace braids
of various kinds, linen thread, two or three sizes of needles, a good
thimble and a pair of fine sharp scissors.</p>

<p>For each kind of lace there is a special sort of braid in various
patterns, and the selection of the thread depends entirely upon the
variety and quality of lace to be made. This selection should be left to
the decision of the teacher or the skilled maker of laces, as she knows
from experience the proper combinations of materials. Thus, in making
Honiton and point lace, thread in twelve different degrees of fineness
is used; and as the braids also vary in size, the thread must always be
adapted to the braid. For Battenburg lace the thread is in eight sizes,
the finest being used only for "whipping curves" or drawing edges into
the outlines required. The "Ideal Honiton" is a new lace made with fancy
Honiton braid and wash-silk floss in dainty colors, and is exquisite for
doilies, mats, table scarfs and center-pieces.</p>

<p>Designs sold by lace-makers are usually drawn upon tracing cloth, as
this is flexible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> and much more agreeable to work upon than any other
material. The tracing cloth, when the braid is arranged, is basted to a
foundation of leather or <i>toile cir&eacute;e</i>; or smooth wrapping-paper may be
basted under the design and will furnish all the support that is
necessary, while being lighter than the <i>toile cir&eacute;e</i>.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the work is really wrong side out while in
progress, so that it will not show its true beauty until finished and
removed from the foundation or pattern. According to the braid and
thread selected, these laces may be made of fairy-like fineness or of
massive elegance&mdash;general results being dainty enough for the gown of a
bride or sumptuous enough for the adornment of an altar.</p>

<p>Lace-making establishments will furnish designs of any width or shape
desired, and will also originate designs for special articles for which
there are only occasional calls. Regular edging designs are ordinarily
made in four widths&mdash;from quite narrow to very wide; and not
infrequently a handkerchief design is enlarged sufficiently to form a
square for a table or a fancy stand.</p>

<p>In filling in the spaces of any design or pattern, the worker may choose
the stitches that please her best, if she does not like those
accompanying the design that she has selected or that has been sent
her.</p>

<p>As in all fancy work which has a set of foundation stitches peculiar to
it that may be varied according to the proficiency and ingenuity of the
maker, so has Modern Lace a series of primary stitches from which may be
evolved many others. A large number of illustrations of stitches, some
of which are primary or foundation stitches, while others are
combinations, are here presented, with full instructions for making; and
the entire series given will make perfectly plain to the student the
ease with which she may combine or invent stitches, when those of the
design she is to work are not to her liking. The first stitch given is
the main foundation stitch.</p>


<h3>PLAIN POINT STITCHES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nos. 1 and 2.&mdash;Point de Bruxelles or Brussels Point.</span>&mdash;Among the stitches
most used in lace-making is Point de Bruxelles or Brussels point. It is
simply a button-hole stitch worked loosely, and it must be done with
regularity, as the beauty of the work depends almost wholly upon the
evenness of the stitches. Brussels point is occasionally used as an
edge, but is more frequently seen in rows worked back and forth to fill
in spaces, or as a ground work. The illustrations clearly represent the
method of making this stitch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No. 3.&mdash;Point de Venise, or Venice Point.</span>&mdash;This stitch is worked from
left to right, like Brussels point. Work 1 loose button-hole stitch, and
in this stitch work 4 button-hole stitches tightly drawn up, then work
another loose button-hole stitch, then 4 more tight button-hole stitches
in the loose one; repeat to the end of the row, and fasten off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No. 4.&mdash;Petit Point de Venise, or Little Venice Point.</span>&mdash;This stitch is
worked in the same manner as point de Venise, but one tight stitch only
is worked in each loose button-hole stitch. This is a most useful stitch
for filling in small spaces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No. 5.&mdash;Italian Lace Stitch.</span>&mdash;Commence at the right side and pass the
thread to the left.</p>

<p><i>First row.</i>&mdash;Make a loose button-hole stitch into the braid to form a
loop, then pass the needle under the line of thread, making the loops an
eighth of an inch apart.</p>

<p><i>Second row.</i>&mdash;Pass the thread back to the left, make a button-hole
stitch in every loop, and pass the needle under the line of thread after
each button-hole stitch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Second row.</i>&mdash;Pass the thread back to the left side, work 3 button-hole
stitches in each loop, taking up the line of thread with the loop, as
seen in the engraving.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No. 7.&mdash;Point Braban&ccedil;on.</span>&mdash;This stitch is worked as follows from left to
right:</p>

<p><i>First row.</i>&mdash;Make 1 long, loose point de Bruxelles, and 1 short loose
one alternately, to end of row.</p>

<p><i>Second row.</i>&mdash;Make 7 tight point de Bruxelles in the 1 long, loose
stitch, and 2 short, loose point de Bruxelles in the short, loose stitch
on previous row, and repeat across the row.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">No. 8.&mdash;Point de Valenciennes, or Valenciennes Stitch.</span>&mdash;This stitch
appears complicated, but is really easy to work. Begin at the left hand
and work 6 point de Bruxelles stitches at unequal distances, every
alternate stitch being the larger.</p>

<p><i>Second row.</i>&mdash;Upon the first large or long stitch, work 9 close
button-hole stitches, then 1 short point de Bruxelles stitch under the
one above, then 9 close stitches, and so on to the end of the row (right
to left).</p>

<p><i>Third row.</i>&mdash;Make 5 close button-hole stitches in the 9 of previous
row, 1 short point de Bruxelles, 2 close, in the Bruxelles stitch, 1
short point de Bruxelles, 5 close, 1 short point de Bruxelles, 2 close,
1 short, 5 close, 1 short and repeat.</p>

<p><i>Fourth row.</i>&mdash;Make 5 close, 1 short point de Bruxelles, 2 close, 1
short, 5 close, 1 short, 2 close, 1 short, and repeat. Continue the rows
until sufficient of the pattern is worked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No. 9.&mdash;Point d'Espagne, or Spanish Point.</span>&mdash;This variety of stitch is
worked from left to right as follows: Insert the needle in the edge of
the braid, keeping the thread turned to the right, and bringing it out
inside the loop formed by the thread (see illustration No. 9); the
needle must pass from the back of the loop through it. Pass the needle

thread, which produces the cord-like appearance of this stitch. At the
end of each row fasten to the braid and sew back, inserting the needle
once in every open stitch.</p>

Plain point d'Alen&ccedil;on is worked over and under in bars in a sort of
herring-bone pattern, and a twisted stitch is made as seen in the

knotting it at the angles as pictured. The effect is similar to one of

stitch as open point d' Espagne. When this is completed the work is gone

<p><span class="smcap">No. 24.&mdash;Rose Point Lace Stitch.</span>&mdash;Make a foundation of single threads,
crossing them to form the large squares. Work a button-hole stitch at
each crossing to make it firm. Now begin at the top, at the right side
and fill the first square with Brussels net stitches, finishing at the
lower left corner. Fill every alternate square in the same way as seen
in the picture.</p>

<p>Now cross the open squares diagonally with two threads, twisting each
thread around the adjoining one as represented. (Carry one thread across
all the squares from corner to corner first, then twist back, fastening
at the corner started from; cross these threads in the same way from the
opposite direction). When twisting the thread back from the last set of
crossings, make a rosette at each center crossing as follows: Keep the
space open with a pin and trace round it with a darning movement five or
six times; commence at the single thread and work a close button-hole
stitch over the tracing entirely around, and then twist along the single
thread to the center of the next square. This is a very effective design
for spaces.</p>


<h3>WHEELS AND ROSETTES.</h3>

<p>Wheels and rosettes are used to fill up spaces, or in combination, to
form lace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No. 25.&mdash;Rosette in Raised Point d'Angleterre.</span>&mdash;This rosette is worked
in a manner similar to the English wheel, the difference being that
after each stitch is passed round and under the bars, the thread is
passed loosely around in the reverse direction, as shown in the
illustration, before proceeding to make the next stitch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No. 26.&mdash;Mechlin Lace Wheels.</span>&mdash;This is one of the prettiest stitches in
point lace, but also one of the most difficult to work correctly. It is
made thus: Work a number of diagonal bars in button-hole stitch on a
single thread in one direction, then begin at the opposite side in the
same way, and work 5 or 6 stitches past the spot where the two lines
cross; pass the thread round the cross twice, under and over the thread
to form a circle. Work in button-hole stitch half of one-quarter, make a
dot by putting a fine pin in the loop instead of drawing the thread
tight, and work 3 button-hole stitches in the loop held open by the pin,
then take the pin out and continue as before. Beginners will do well to
omit the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> dot, leaving the loop only on the wheel. Mechlin wheels are
also worked in rows upon horizontal and parallel lines of thread.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No. 27.&mdash;English Wheel.</span>&mdash;This is worked in the same manner as Sorrento
wheels, but instead of <i>winding</i> the thread over and under the bars, the
needle is inserted under each bar, and brought out again between the
thread and the last stitch; this produces a kind of button-hole stitch,
and gives the square, firm appearance possessed by this wheel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nos. 28 and 30.&mdash;Sorrento Wheel.</span>&mdash;This is worked by fastening the thread
in the pattern to be filled up, as indicated by the letters. Fasten it
first to the place <i>a</i>, then at place <i>b</i>, carrying it back to the
middle of the first formed bar by winding it round; fasten again at <i>c</i>,
carrying it back again to the center by winding it around the bar, and
so on to all the letters; then work over and under the bars thus formed.</p>

<h3>BARS AND PICOTS.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></h3>

<p>The word "Bar" is applied to the many stitches used to connect the
various parts of point lace, and the beauty of the work depends greatly
upon the class of bar selected and its suitability to the lace stitches
used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nos. 31 and 32.&mdash;Raleigh Bars.</span>&mdash;These bars are much used in making
Battenburg lace and are very effective. They are worked over a
foundation or net-work of coarse thread, and are twisted in places so
that they will more easily fall into the desired form.</p>

<p>By following the numbering from 1 to 21, in No. 31, a square place may
be easily filled, and portions of this arrangement applied to form
ground-work of any shape desired. Upon this ground-work tight point de
Bruxelles stitches are made, and the dot worked upon these in one of the
following ways:</p>

<p class="caption">No. 31.&mdash;Net-work for Working Raleigh Bars.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot or Picot.</span>&mdash;<i>First Method.</i>&mdash;Make 5 tight point de Bruxelles
stitches, 1 loose point de Bruxelles; pass the needle under the loop and
over the thread, as shown in point de Venise bars at No. 47, on page 18,
and draw up, leaving a small, open loop as in tatting. Work 5 tight
point de Bruxelles stitches, and repeat.</p>

<p><i>Second Method.</i>&mdash;Proceed as above directed, but instead of continuing
the tight stitches, work two or three tight stitches in the loop thus
formed and repeat.</p>

<p class="caption">No. 32.&mdash;Raleigh Bars.</p>

<p><i>Third Method.</i>&mdash;Work 4 tight point de Bruxelles stitches; 1 loose,
through which pass the needle point, wind the thread three or four times
round the point (see No. 48, page 18), press the thumb tightly on this,
and draw the needle and thread through the twists. This is a quick mode
of making the picot, and imitates most closely the real Spanish lace.</p>

<p>Illustration No. 48 shows how this stitch may also be
applied as a <i>regular</i> ground-work, but the beauty of old point
ground-work bars consists of variety in form.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>In making modern lace, the various kinds require appropriate braids.
There are three classes of these braids&mdash;those for Battenburg lace,
those for plain Honiton and point, and those for the newest kind of
lace, which is called the "Ideal Honiton." Each class of braids contains
many designs and widths, and a large number of them, together with
various cords, buttons and rings also used are illustrated on following
pages.</p>



<h2><a name="FANCY_BRAIDS_CORDS_RINGS_AND_BUTTONS" id="FANCY_BRAIDS_CORDS_RINGS_AND_BUTTONS"></a>FANCY BRAIDS, CORDS, RINGS AND BUTTONS.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></h2>


<h3>BRAIDS.</h3>

<p>The braids, cords, rings and buttons illustrated upon the following two
pages are all used in modern lace-making. They are all made of pure
linen thread, and according to the fancy, the lace including them may be
heavy or light. Royal Battenburg lace, as originated, was heavy&mdash;in some
cases massive; but at present many lighter varieties are made, as will
be surmised upon an inspection of the braids for its manufacture which
are represented on the pages mentioned. As shown by No. 1, these braids
are about a third narrower than their actual width, and the picot edges
numbered 16 and 17 are plain tatting made for the purpose, as the picot
edges woven for lighter laces are not heavy enough for Battenburg lace.
The numbers opposite the specimens are simply for convenience in
ordering, if the order is sent the lady mentioned in another part of the
book as the Pioneer of Lace-Making in America; but in ordering from
other lace-makers or manufacturers of braids, these numbers will be of
little use, as every lace-maker or manufacturer has his or her own
individual identifications for materials. Almost any of the braids, or
those very similar, may be found at large fancy stores, but in buying
them at such stores, be careful to get <i>linen</i> braids, as cotton braids
do not make pretty lace, neither do they wear or launder well. In
ordering these braids from other lace-makers or from fancy stores, it
will be necessary to forward the illustration of the kind wanted, as the
braids cannot be described with sufficient accuracy to obtain the
desired varieties. Some are sold by the yard, some by the dozen yards
and others by the piece, according to the position to be occupied in the
work.</p>

<p>The point, Honiton and Princess braids are represented full size, and
are much daintier in texture than the Battenburg braids. Of this class
of braids (see No. 2) are made the plain Honiton and point laces, and
the braids for these two laces combined produce the Princess lace&mdash;a
creation whose beauty fully entitles it to its royal name.</p>

<p>The braids seen at No. 3, page 21, are those which are used in making
the new "Ideal Honiton" lace represented in another portion of the book.
As illustrated, these braids are three-quarters of their proper widths,
the top braid, No. 38, being just one inch wide in the fabric itself.
The "Ideal Honiton" is one of the prettiest laces made, and is very
appropriate for tidies, doilies, squares and scarfs. It is daintily
secured to the finest of lawn in charming designs, and then the lawn is
cut out from beneath it. (See doily, page 33).</p>

<p>The cords seen at No. 4 are used in making Battenburg laces, and greatly
increase the beauty of the work in addition to forming a distinctive
species of lace. After the ordinary Battenburg is worked with quite
thick braid, the cord, in any size desired, is used to follow one edge
of the design, as will be seen from illustrations upon other following
pages.</p>


<h3>RINGS AND BUTTONS.</h3>

<p>The rings and buttons illustrated, are made throughout of linen thread
in layers of button-hole stitches, and are sold by the dozen or gross.
Buttons arranged as grapes (see No. 50, page 21), add greatly to the
sumptuous effect of a heavy lace, and may be purchased already arranged
as illustrated, or they may be arranged by the purchaser of a quantity
of them. The latter method is a good plan if spaces are to be filled
with clusters which must be of a certain shape.</p>

<p>Of necessity, most of the designs and specimens given on this and the
following pages are smaller than the articles they represent, but they
afford a correct idea of the method of making and the beauty of Modern
Lace, and also its adaptability to dainty accessories of the toilet and
the household. As before mentioned any design desired can be obtained
from any lace-making establishment in any size, width or shape,
according to the requirements of the article or lace to be made, and
individual taste. Ingenious students will no doubt be able to adapt for
themselves the designs offered, but it is not advisable for those who
have no talent in the matter of drawing or designing to undertake an
elaborate adaptation, though they may easily accomplish a simple one.
Besides, a professional designer will furnish the design for a moderate
sum, perfectly outlined upon tracing cloth, with ink, and with the
proper filling-in stitches perfectly delineated; and if the student
wishes it, will select the thread and braid appropriate for the design;
or the student may select the braid she fancies, and the designer will
then select the thread suitable for the braid.</p>


<h3>No. 1.<br />
DESIGN FOR A LACE HANDKERCHIEF.</h3>

<p>This design is suitable for point lace braid, but is of course very much
reduced in size, in order to show the effect and arrangement of a design
ready for working, as sent out from the lace-maker's. By a reference to
the various stitches illustrated on preceding pages, the stitches shown
in one corner of the design may be readily identified. The following
engraving shows how braid is applied to a design before the stitches are
begun.</p>

<h3>No. 2.<br />
METHOD OF PLACING BRAID UPON DESIGNS.</h3>

<p>This illustration shows the method of arranging braid upon designs for
modern lace, and how, after the braid is basted along the pattern, the
tracing cloth is basted to <i>toile <ins class="correction" title="circ&eacute;">cir&eacute;e</ins></i> or to smooth, light
brown wrapping paper to provide sufficient firmness for working.</p>

<p>The following instructions apply particularly to engraving No. 2, but
their principle should be observed and applied to any design decided
upon, as good results in lace-making largely depend upon the arrangement
of the braid.</p>

<p>Run on a straight line of braid for the lower edge, with fine stitches,
working as shown, from left to right. Take another piece of braid, or
the other end of the same piece, and begin to lay the braid by "running"
stitches in its center, keeping it as smooth and even as possible. The
outer edge presents no difficulty, but the inner edge will not lie
evenly without being drawn in by a needle and thread, as follows: Fasten
whipping thread securely, and insert the needle in and out of the edge
of the braid, as if for fine gathering; this thread when drawn up will
keep the braid in its place. Two or three fastening-off stitches should
be worked when each circle, half circle, or rounded curve of a pattern
is finished, as the drawing or gathering thread remains in the work, and
forms an important, though unseen, part of its structure.</p>

<p>Before cutting off the braid run a few stitches across it to prevent it
from widening. Joins should be avoided, but when a join is
indispensable, stitch the braid together, open and turn back the ends,
and stitch each portion down separately. When passing the thread from
one part to another, run it along the center of the braid, allowing the
stitches to show as little as possible. In commencing, make a few
stitches, leaving the end of the thread on the wrong side and cutting it
off afterwards. In fastening off, make a tight button-hole stitch, run
in three stitches, bring the needle out at the back, and cut off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

ROYAL BATTENBURG LACE BUREAU-SCARF.</h3>

<p>The engraving on the opposite page represents the article above
mentioned, and shows the effectiveness of this magnificent and durable
lace. In actual size the scarf is about a yard and one-half long and
one-half yard wide, and is made of a heavy Battenburg braid, having a
fancy edge (See Nos. 5 or 7, on page 20) and cord, rings and buttons.
The main part of the design is outlined with the braid, cord is used as
a veining for the leaves, and the rings and buttons are introduced here
and there over the surface, as seen in the picture. Raleigh bars with
picots connect the border and center designs, while the palms along the
border as well as other small spaces are filled in with point Turque and
point de Grecque stitches. Sorrento bars are also used in some of the
long leaf-like spaces, while in a few of the circular spaces point
d'Angleterre rosettes are introduced. These rosettes are also frequently
called "spiders," and are made, according to the space, large or small;
and according to the requirements of the braid selected, heavy or light.</p>

<p>For convenience in giving the name of this lace, the full title is
rarely used&mdash;"Battenburg Lace" being considered sufficient to identify
the fabric from the other and lighter laces.</p>

<p>Battenburg lace is made both heavy and light, according to personal
taste or the object for which the lace is intended, but it was
originally designed for heavy work only.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

POINT LACE DOILY FOR A TOILET CUSHION.</h3>

<p>This dainty doily may be made of the point lace braids illustrated at
Nos. 30 and 31, together with the picot edging No. 36, seen on page 20.
In filling in the spaces, thread suitable for the braid is used, and the
stitches are point de Valenciennes, point d'Espagne, Sorrento bars,
point de Bruxelles, open rings and "spiders." As all of these stitches,
with many others are illustrated in that section of this book devoted to
stitches, it will be unnecessary to repeat the details for making, as
they are fully given in the department mentioned. It will also be
understood that most of the articles illustrated are not of full size,
but in some instances are nearly so. The doily just described is
illustrated about three-quarters of its actual size; but by using a fine
braid a doily of fairy-like texture, and just the size of the engraving
may be produced. Any one accustomed to drawing may enlarge this or any
of the designs given, but only clever fingers should try this
experiment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

BATTENBURG EDGING, WITH CORD.</h3>

<p>This is a very elegant looking lace, though simply made after the
regular Battenburg method. A plain braid (No. 10, page 20) is chosen to
form the outlines, and after the stitches are filled in, cord of a
suitable size is carried around the petals and foliage of the design,
and rows of it are also used to indicate the vine, though the latter may
be outlined with the tape and then with the cord. The petals of the
blossoms are filled in in point de Bruxelles and point de Venise
stitches, while point d'Espagne and point Braban&ccedil;on are used for the
foliage and vine. Point Grecque and d'Alen&ccedil;on bars are also used at the
very heart of the blossom, and Raleigh net-work bars connect the design
to the edge and are dotted here and there with "spiders."</p>

DOILY IN "IDEAL HONITON" LACE-WORK AND LINEN LAWN.</h3>

<p>One of the prettiest and the very newest of the modern laces is here
illustrated. It is made of two of the many varieties of Honiton braids,
wash-silk floss and linen lawn. The braid is basted smoothly upon a
square of lawn in the design illustrated (though individual taste will
no doubt suggest many other equally pretty designs), after which the
<i>inner</i> edges of the braid are permanently secured by a "short and long
stitch." This is merely a short and long button-hole stitch <i>reversed</i>
so that the cross loops are on the edge of the braid, while the stitches
them selves extend beyond the braid, into the lawn, as seen in the
engraving. Two short stitches alternate with single long ones throughout
this part of the work. The outer edges are then fastened to the square
by tiny button-hole scollops. Then the lawn is cut from under the
squares formed by the braid, and the openings are button-holed through
the lawn and braid so that the edges of the lawn will not fray. When
this is done the spaces are filled in with fancy stitches, and when they
are completed the lawn is cut away from the edge-scollops with a pair of
fine sharp, scissors. In the doily illustrated "spiders" and point de
Venise stitches are used for filling in the spaces. The floss used may
be white or tinted, the latter washing as well as the white; but as a
rule, white or yellow flosses are selected in preference to other
colors. "Ideal Honiton" scarfs, tidies, doilies, pillow shams, tray
cloths, etc., etc., may be purchased with the braid already basted on in
a pretty design and with the necessary threads or floss, or they may be
designed at home, and by either method will result in a beautiful
variety of modern lace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

DESIGN FOR A CORNER IN BATTENBURG LACE.</h3>

<p>Although this design is intended for Battenburg lace, and may be made up
of any of the braids used for that kind of lace, it will also be found
suitable for the finer point or Honiton braids for handkerchiefs,
doilies, mats, etc., etc. As illustrated it would be suitable for a
handkerchief. Enlarged and followed in Battenburg braid it would make a
very handsome border for a table-scarf, curtains or draperies, or a
substantial decoration for a gown of wash fabric or other goods. Raleigh
bars, "spiders" and point de Bruxelles stitches are used for filling in,
and a dainty picot edge is sewed to the outer line of the braid. Plain
or fancy braid may be used for this design. If fancy loop-edge braid is
selected, the picot edge will not be needed, the loops taking its

BATTENBURG EDGING.</h3>

<p>The edging here illustrated is represented about one-third less than its
actual width, but the design is so distinctly brought out that its
beauty in any width may be readily conceived. It is formed of fancy
Battenburg braid, but may be made from a plain variety if preferred. The
design is known as the fern leaf and is easy to follow. Sorrento bars
are used to connect the work, and "spiders" are made here and there to
add variety to the work. Point de Bruxelles stitches are used to fill in
the spaces at the sides of the leaves, and, with the fancy braid,
produce a very dainty, delicate effect.</p>

FINGER-BOWL DOILY OF PRINCESS LACE AND LINEN LAWN.</h3>

<p>Princess lace, (also known as Duchesse lace) as elsewhere mentioned,
results from combining Honiton and point lace braids in one design; and
a charming specimen of this lovely lace is here illustrated.</p>

<p>The doily is pictured only a trifle smaller than its actual size, and
even in its full size is a very dainty affair. After the braids are
basted along the design, they are then connected by twisted bars that
are an adaptation from the point d'Alen&ccedil;on bars with the twisted stitch;
and the spaces are filled in in small d'Angleterre rosettes or
"spiders." As few bars as possible are employed for the spiders, in

<p>As suggested by the title, the design here presented may be used for
insertion, or for a center to a table cloth or scarf, or a handsome
spread. As represented it is intended for a center-piece, and the lace
from which the engraving was made is about half-a-yard long and
one-fourth of a yard wide. The ground-work is formed of Raleigh bars
made with picots, and the loops of braid are filled in with twisted
point d'Alen&ccedil;on bars.</p>

The center is of fine table-linen, while the edge is formed of

"spiders," the large border spaces and corresponding corner ones are
filled in with picot bars, while the very fine work seen in the
triangles and square spaces are point de Venise stitches, and

<p>Butterflies for the corners of handkerchiefs, scarf-ends and the points
of caps or coiffures are favorite designs in point and Honiton laces.
The one illustrated is very dainty and exceedingly simple to execute.
The upper portion of each wing has a point de reprise ground-work, but
the solid sections are tiny spiders instead of point de reprise
triangles. The outer tips of the wings are filled in with Raleigh bars,
while similar bars, point de Bruxelles stitches and a point d'Angleterre
rosette complete the lower wings. Any of the fine point or Honiton
braids may be chosen for the outlining of the butterfly, and a fine
over-and-over stitch or fine cord may be used to mark the lines
extending from the head.</p>

<p>The design here illustrated was found in the old church of Santa
Margherita, in Italy. It was drawn on parchment, and was undoubtedly
intended as a design for altar lace. It was mentioned in a book of
accounts for the year 1592, found in the archives of the church
designated and is therefore of antique origin; but it may be easily
adapted to modern methods of lace-making, and could be appropriately
filled in with either Italian or Genoa lace stitches or with a
combination of both, and twisted bars. Done with fancy Battenburg braid,
it would be quite similar in effect to the "Cardinal's Point"

BATTENBURG CHURCH LACE.</h3>

<p>The engraving opposite illustrates a magnificent specimen of Modern
Church Lace made of Battenburg braid with a limited introduction of
Honiton braid. The specimen itself is considerably wider than
represented, but as the width is a matter of individual taste, the
engraving will serve as a design for a narrow church lace.</p>

<p>Sorrento bars are used to connect the braids and to form foundations for
the spiders or rosettes here and there inserted, and the lace is
delicately bordered with a dainty picot-braid. The fancy stitches in the
main portions of the cross are point de Valenciennes, while those in the
minor sections are point de Bruxelles.</p>

<p>Point de fillet is used for the central portion of the large T-shaped
symbol, while the stitch forming the other symbol is one never used
except for church lace, and consists of two or three sets of fine
stitches so interlaced as to seem to form one solid stitch.</p>

ALTAR LACE (BATTENBURG).</h3>

<p>This very elegant specimen of altar lace is, in reality, about nine or
ten inches deep; but, for want of space the engraving represents it as
only about half as wide. The design, however, is perfect in detail, and
the illustration fully displays its effectiveness, and discloses the
variety of connecting and filling-in stitches used. A delicate
Battenburg braid is chosen for the foundation, and in addition to
regular lace stitches, those from drawn work are here and there
interspersed. The cross is filled in in point de Venise, (or side stitch
as it is sometimes called), and the same stitch is seen in the central
design at each side of the cross. Drawn-work effects are seen also in
these central figures and along the borders. Sorrento bars are here made
and knotted at the center like drawn strands, or are connected by
rosettes or "spiders" made in drawn-work style. At the center of the
cross is a large drawn-work wheel, while small Maltese crosses and
half-crosses are made elsewhere in the work by the drawn-work method,
Sorrento bars taking the place of the usual strands. The central section
of the border at the right of the cross is done in point de Bruxelles
which is afterward button-holed as in bar-work, and a button-hole picot
edge follows the lower outlines of the pattern. Raleigh bars with picots
form the connecting ground-work throughout the work. This beautiful

BATTENBURG OR POINT LACE COLLAR AND CUFF.</h3>

<p>These engravings represent a very graceful design for a lace collar and
cuffs. As suggested in the title, the set may be made of point or
Battenburg braid. The leaf-points are all filled in with d'Alen&ccedil;on bars
in the twisted stitch, while the centers are completed with rosettes or
small open "spiders," and the latter are distributed elsewhere as will
be seen by inspecting the engraving. Point de Grecque is also introduced
into some of the spaces, and Raleigh bars are used for the ground-work.
Any of the stitches previously described may be used in making such a
collar if those mentioned are not admired; and the addition of buttons
or rings will improve the work greatly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

FLOUNCE IN BATTENBURG LACE.</h3>

<p>A very elegant flounce of Battenburg lace may be made after the design
represented on the opposite page. The picture shows the flounce just
one-half its actual width; but even this width would be very handsome as
a band for the bottom of a dress. By a close inspection of the stitches
seen and a reference to these illustrated in the department devoted to
stitches, the various kinds here used may be easily identified. They
consist of point de Venise, point de Bruxelles, Sorrento and
<ins class="correction" title="Alen&ccedil;on">d'Alen&ccedil;on</ins> bars and "spiders." A fine picot braid edges each

made after an adaptation from the d'Alen&ccedil;on bars, and point de Venise
stitches are used for filling in. The butterfly may be used as a portion

<p>The engraving shows a reduced representation of a very elegant specimen
of modern lace&mdash;the reduction in size being necessary in order to
present the whole design. In making the lace, narrow braid and cord are
used for the foundation of the design, and then the filling-in stitches
are made and at the same time rings and buttons and bars and picots are
introduced. Some of the filling-in stitches are combinations&mdash;as in the
figures with very open bars where point d'Espagne and point Braban&ccedil;on
are combined, and at the middle section of the central figure where
point de Valenciennes and point Braban&ccedil;on are combined. Other stitches
used are d'Alen&ccedil;on bars, Raleigh bars, church stitch, point de
Bruxelles, "spiders," Sorrento bars, and picots. The greater the variety
in the filling-in stitches, the more beautiful the lace. A picot edge
finishes the lace in a very dainty manner along its lower outline, while

PILLOW-SHAM OF BATTENBURG LACE AND LINEN.</h3>

<p>A very elaborate pillow-sham is here illustrated. It is made of
Battenburg braid and appropriate thread, together with an intermingling
of rings, and forms one of the most elegant appointments of a handsomely
furnished bed-room. The pattern is very distinct and is called the "rose

while the centers of the roses and their leaves are filled in in various
fancy stitches which include the crosses and rosettes used in
drawn-work, Sorrento bars, points de Venise and Bruxelles, d'Alen&ccedil;on
bars, etc., etc. If desired the linen square may be made larger, and the
lace but one row of blossoms in width. The square is made of the finest
household linen and is completed with a broad hem-stitched hem before
the lace is added. The lace design may be obtained in any width desired

ROYAL BATTENBURG LACE.</h3>

<p>This design was among the first ones of this lace to appear, and is
fully entitled to its royal name. Fancy Battenburg braid was selected
for the foundation, and various stitches chosen for filling-in purposes.
Among the stitches are point de Bruxelles, made similarly to the Italian
lace stitch, point de fillet, plain Raleigh bars, point d'Alen&ccedil;on,
rosettes, rings and point de Grecque. The central figure conveys a hint
of the outlines of the royal crown, and the lace is really sumptuous in
design and texture. In 1883, Mrs. Grace McCormick, the originator of the
design and lace was awarded a diploma for her work which was forwarded
from Washington, where she applied for a patent for her specimens of
Royal Battenburg lace, of which this is one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>The design here given is for a lappet or scarf-end, and will afford a
suggestion for the making of larger articles or edging in similar
arrangements of braid. It will be observed that the braid forms
irregular lines that recall the branchings of coral, and it will be a
very easy matter for an amateur lace-maker to similarly arrange her
braid for any purpose she desires. Fine Raleigh bars form the connecting
work, and a button-hole picot-finish is made along the edge of the braid
which forms the border. In making an edging, a definite outline could be
kept for the lower edge, and above this an irregular or indefinite
outline arranged.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

TIDY OF BATTENBURG LACE.</h3>

<p>The tidy here illustrated is made entirely of Battenburg lace, and is a
beautiful specimen of this kind of work. The border design is the same
as the one previously described for a pillow-sham, except that but one
row of the blossoms and foliage is used. The center is composed of rows
of braid crossed to form squares or open spaces that are filled in with
rosettes in point d'Angleterre. This center is attached to the braid at
the inner edge of the border by a series of bars arranged in d'Alen&ccedil;on
style and then wrought with the thread after the method used in d'Anvers
bars. This tidy, enlarged, forms an elegant design for a pillow-sham.
When laid over a tinted silk spread or pillow, a sham of this design
shows its full beauty. When the braid is basted on in the outlines
desired, the remainder of the work will be a pleasing pastime, as none
of it is so fine as to require very close attention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

LOUIS XIV. CURTAIN-LACE.</h3>

<p>This is a very popular decoration for curtains and vestibule doors and
is made of heavy &eacute;cru or white net and braid. The design selected is
generally a border with a corner piece, and sometimes a center piece.
The specimen here given is simply a square of the net decorated as
illustrated to convey an idea of this at present fashionable curtain
lace. The design is first traced on tracing cloth that is then underlaid
with brown paper to hold it stiffly in place. The net is then laid over
this and smoothly basted down so that the tracing shows through plainly.
Then &eacute;cru or white Battenburg braid is used to follow the design, and is
shaped into the leaves and flowers seen, rings being used for the
centers of the blossoms and &eacute;cru or white cord for the stems. The net is
cut from under the rings at the centers of the large roses, and each
opening is filled in with point de fillet and English wheels. The effect
is very rich and the work is not difficult to do.</p>

<p>When a curtain is thus embroidered or decorated with braid, it is
bordered the same as the square illustrated, or upon that principle,
with rows and points of Battenburg braid. Ribbon is often used in this
way for tidies, bureau scarfs and various other little household
decorations, and in this event the flower and foliage tints may be
carried out in the design.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>Bobbin net, or "bobbinet," or "net" as it is now commonly called, was
first made by machinery in 1809, and was so called because the threads
from which it was made were wound upon bobbins, and <i>twisted</i> into
meshes instead of being <i>looped</i> in knitting style as they were previous
to the invention of the machine. The latter was invented by John
Heathcoat, the son of an English farmer; but to France must be given the
credit of introducing the "darned work" by which some of its costliest
net laces were first made. From these laces originated the industry of
darning net by machinery and by hand, and in all grades from fine
silk-blonde and Brussels net to the coarsest wash net, such as is used
for curtains and draperies.</p>

<p>In the earlier days the pattern was stamped on the net by means of
wooden blocks, and the net was then placed in a frame, and the darner
with her left hand under the lace followed the design with her needle
and cotton, linen or silk floss held over the work in the right hand.
This method may be employed at the present time; or, the design may be
drawn on thick paper and the net basted over it; or, if the net is
coarse the design may be followed by counting the meshes and inserting
the needle and floss accordingly; or the design may be transferred to
the net itself by black or colored pencils, or stamping. The darner must
decide for herself which method for holding the work she will use. Some
of the most expert darners simply hold the net loosely in their hands
and copy the design by eye alone. Wash-silk floss, India floss which is
of linen but looks like silk, and ordinary darning flosses are all used
for this work. Darned net is liked for many purposes, as will be
observed by the variety of designs and illustrations given on these
pages.</p>

SCARF-END OF DARNED NET.</h3>

<p>This illustration pictures a very pretty scarf-end, but presents it only
half of its actual width. The scarf is about a yard in length and is
darned with linen floss and edged with the finest feather-edge braid.
The center portions of the flowers and foliage are cut out after the
solid darning is made, and the spaces are then filled in with a fancy
mesh done with fine cotton in point de Bruxelles stitch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

TIDY OF DARNED NET.</h3>

<p>This engraving represents a charming little tidy made of coarse wash-net
darned with wash-silk floss in Oriental colorings. The tidy has an inch
wide hem and is about eleven inches wide and twelve long. The hem is
fastened down by three rows of darning stitches, the outer row being
deep garnet, the middle row bright old-rose and the inner row deep
orange. One small fan is made of the orange and pale-blue, another of
the old-rose with sulphur-yellow, and the third peacock-blue and
crimson. One large fan is made of pale-pink and silver-gray (darned
together), and wood-brown; another is made of the garnet and the
sulphur-yellow, while the third is made of orange and pale-blue. The
scrolls meeting at the center are made, one of wood-brown, one of
sulphur-yellow and one of garnet, and the rest of the design is made in
different shades of dull green. Laid over white, this tidy is very
effective. It may be darned in one color on white, black or &eacute;cru net if
preferred, and with linen floss.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

three-quarters of a yard long, and is darned in all-over style in the
design seen in the engraving, with linen floss. A line of fine
feather-edge braid finishes the tie in a dainty manner. This design may
be used for any other article preferred, and its details will also
suggest other designs of a similar character which may be invented by
the worker. This scarf as well as the others just described, may be made
up in black if preferred; and in this event it will be easier for the
darner to follow the meshes if she bastes her net over a white

DARNED-NET EDGING, WITH OVER-WROUGHT STITCH.</h3>

<p>This handsome edging is darned upon a wide strip of net with coarse and
fine embroidery cotton, and after the pattern is completed the lower
edge of the net is cut away. The coarse cotton is used to outline the
design and fill in some of the central portions, while the fine is
darned in between the outer and center portions, and is used for the
over-wrought portions. These portions are "run" back and forth loosely
to form a raised foundation for the buds and rose-centers before the
over-wrought work is done. The edging is given full-size and no
difficulty will be experienced in following the design or making the
lace; and the design may be adapted to any article of wear that can be
made of darned net. A scarf or kerchief, dotted with rosebuds made like
those of this design would be a very dainty article of personal
adornment; and the buds might be made of pale-pink or yellow floss with
a charming effect. The floral idea might be further carried out by using
shaded green floss for the foliage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

DARNED-NET EDGINGS.</h3>

<p>It will not be necessary to give special instructions for either of the
edgings here illustrated, as both are given full size and the designs
are perfectly distinct. No. 7 is finished with a button-holed scallop
from which the net is cut away when the work is completed. Either edging
may be made of white, &eacute;cru or black net as preferred, and the floss may
be white or tinted, or of cotton, linen or silk.</p>

<p>In making No. 8 upon black net, silver or gilt thread or colored flosses
will be found very effective. Black net thus darned is very pretty for
ruching and jabots for dress-waists.</p>

<p>In making darned edgings, net may be purchased in various edging widths,
and in this style is often called "footing." When bobbin net (or
bobbinet as it is now called) was first invented, it was made only one
inch wide but now it may be purchased three and one-half yards wide if
desired.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

PILLOW-SHAM OF DARNED NET.</h3>

<p>This engraving represents one of the many uses to which darned net is
put. Moderately coarse net was selected, and the darning was done with
linen floss in the various patterns seen, and which are repeated in a
larger form on the following pages. The sham was hemmed after the
darning was finished, and a frill of darned-net edging was then added.
Tinted silk or sateen should be laid under such a sham in order to bring
out the beauty of the work. The ambitious darner may make a bed-spread
to correspond with her shams, if she has the time to devote to the task
and the patience to complete it; and in making such a set, she need not
confine herself to the designs here given, but may select any others she
admires, or may originate a design herself. Individual ideas as to
decoration so widely differ, that clever workers are sure to evolve
designs of various characters and a generally uniform beauty. Blossoms,
leaves, carvings, Oriental figures, brocades, etc., etc., all afford
dainty ideas for designs for darned net.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

seen by referring to No. 12 on page 113, where a large illustration of
it is seen supplemented by a vine-border at each side. The outer border
of this center-piece is very simple, and may be darned in diamonds as
large or as small as desired.</p>

here represented it will be easy to copy either for a pillow-sham or for

as an insertion, a border or an edging; and she may also use her own
taste as to darning with white or colored floss, or using white, &eacute;cru,

END OF DRAPERY-SCARF OF DARNED NET.</h3>

<p>The end of the drapery-scarf from which this engraving was made is about
fourteen inches square, and the sides are turned under for about a
quarter of an inch, or a little more, and darned down closely to
represent a selvedge. The design is Oriental in outline and is easy to
follow. As represented the scarf is made of white net and darned with
white linen floss; but the Oriental effect may be carried out more
perfectly if the darning is done with colored flosses with an
intermingling of silver or gilt thread. White, black, &eacute;cru or colored
net may be used. Two ends are made and then gathered to a smaller square
of net. This small square is then drawn together through the center
under a bow of wide satin ribbon, and the scarf is then fastened to the
article of furniture it is to decorate. To its ends may be added
tassels, rings or any edge-finish that is in accord with the materials
of the scarf. Black net darned with gold, crimson, peacock-blue, and
pale-yellow and pale-olive, results in a charmingly Eastern or Oriental
effect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

DESIGN FOR DARNED NET.</h3>

<p>This engraving represents a flounce of darned-net in its actual size or
width. It will be seen that the design is simple, but at the same time
very effective. The flounce is for a child's dress made of net darned
all over in the pattern seen in the picture, and worn over a tinted silk
slip. The all-over work is very pretty indeed, and the design may be put
to any of the many uses for which darned net is suitable. It is pretty
for yokes, pillow-shams, counterpanes, infants' dresses and
carriage-robes, parasol-covers, sofa-pillow covers, and in fact for any
article that may be made of lace.</p>

<p>The points of the flounce are darned back and forth in selvedge effect;
but they may be worked in button-hole stitch if preferred. A touch of
color may be given the work by using a little tinted or colored floss
with the white, though the latter is most generally selected for darning
net. In using tints, more delicate shades will be found in silk
darning-flosses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

not be counted a real outlay, as only odd moments of leisure were

DESIGNS FOR DARNED NET.</h3>

<p>Both of these designs are very pretty for diverse purposes, and also
very easy to follow. Either may be used as a heading, an insertion or a
border, separately or in conjunction with other designs. Many of the
suggestions given concerning other designs upon previous pages will
apply to these two designs, which fact leaves little to suggest for them
individually. Each darner will think out for herself many uses to which
to put designs, many combinations in which they will prove effective,
and many colorings suggested by the tints which govern her room or her
wardrobe; all of which would be an impossible task for any one person,
unacquainted with the surroundings of all our students to accomplish.
One idea from one person will suggest another idea to a second person,
and thus, in the lace-work at the beginning and after part of this book,
as in all fancy work, upon an evolution of ideas must rest the great
responsibility of an endless variety of designs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>
